**Simulation of Logistic Systems - R Programming**

This repository contains work from the *Simulación de Sistemas Logísticos* course, which focused on discrete-event simulation and its applications in logistics. The course covered model building, random variable generation, statistical analysis of simulated data, and the use of R for practical implementations.

### Key Project:
- **Robot Replacement Simulation:**  
  Simulated the operation of a repair workshop with two robot configurations, analyzing costs, queue times, and downtime over thousands of iterations. The study supported decision-making on whether to replace the current robot with a more efficient alternative.

This repository demonstrates the use of simulation techniques to address real-world logistic challenges with robust data-driven decision-making.
